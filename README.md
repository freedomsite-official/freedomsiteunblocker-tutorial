# (unofficial but useful) *FreedomSite* Unblocker Tutorial..
This is a setup guide for freedomsite unblocker, a method created by `SGFycmlzb24=` *(b64 btw).*

### Firstly: 
You'd need to gain access to the freedomsite-official account on Github. 


To get access: you need to either: 


- A, find someone willing to hand it to you (via word-of-mouth). 
This method is usually what most people prefer but I might stop this from happening by changing the password every few months (to prevent 100s of people logging into the account at a given time..)


- B, going to the official captcha (``sites.google.com/site/freedomsite-v1-captcha/start`` ) and completing it to get the code, which you can then use to log into the site. This option is a more viable solution as you don't need to externally go to other people to get code access.



### Setup:


You will need to understand the syntax of node.js and it being used in a bash terminal as you'd be utilising something called `Github Codespaces`.
Github Codespaces is an online IDE to run stuff on a VPS (virtual private server).

All you need to remember is:
```node
npm install
npm start
```

People also ask, why not *pnpm*?, and yes, that is infact a better option but it isnt installed on Github Codespaces as default (unless the repository has it installed).

# Start:

Go to the codespace servers that have been created for you. There are usually 2-3 online, if one is acting faulty or really slow, then try another:
There is `freedomengine-1` and `freedomengine-2`.

Now, once you click on it, you'll open up in a terminal, just go to the console which will say;
> type 'npm install' and 'npm start' to initiate!

Remember to separate via equals sign.. and you should be done!
